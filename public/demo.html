    <p>Welcome to Selenium tutorial. In this tutorial, we'll
            work with Selenium WebDriver, but first of all, an introduction to WebDriver.
            WebDriver is an open source and free tool. It was released in the year
            2009 and it is a very popular
            tool for test automation of web applications.
            Now,
            the difference between Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver is that the Selenium IDE works only with the Firefox browser.
            But WebDriver works with multiple browsers like Firefox, IE, Chrome and other browsers.
            It also works on a number of operating systems like Windows,
            Mac, Linux and Solaris.</p></p>
            And in WebDriver, you have to write your own test automation code in any
            programming language that is supported. So, WebDriver supports a number of
            popular programming languages like Java, C#, Ruby, Python and so on.
            WebDriver is really powerful and fun to use.
            So it makes it a very popular tool of choice for test automation of web applications.
            Now, let us get started with WebDriver.</p></p>
            First of all, let us see
            where we can get WebDriver? So, first of all you have to go to the official selenium web site which is
            www.seleniumhq.org
            Download tab and in the Download tab, there are different sections for different tools.
            For example, the first section is for selenium IDE. You scroll a little below you will come across Selenium WebDriver.
            In this demo, we'll be using the Java programming language, so we need to download Selenium WebDriver for Java.
            Now one thing to keep in mind. Is that the Selenium WebDriver is not a tool with its own UI or
            something that you need to install etc.</p></p>
            Basically, it is a library of built-in methods that work on different web browsers like
            Firefox, Internet Explorer and Chrome.</p></p>
            So, we need to download the Selenium WebDriver
            library and use it along with our programming language of choice in order to create the test automation script.
            So, within the Selenium WebDriver section,
            just click on the download link over here.
            And it says
            where do you want to save this file? So I am going to save this file in
            my local computer.</p></p>
            So, I can save it in
            webdriver and let me save it over here.
            So, it takes a few seconds to save it.
            Now, it is in the form of a zip archive, so I need to unzip it also.
            So, let me just
            do that.
            So, I saved it
            over here.
            And
            the Selenium WebDriver is now downloaded.
            So let me close this and now, I can extract it and I can extract it in the same folder.
            Now, meantime it is extracting so
            what we are going to do is use
            Selenium WebDriver and
            automate a test on our web application so today what we are going to do is automate some
            user actions on
            the Wikipedia website, so let me show you what we are trying to achieve today.
            So, if I go to
            Wikipedia...
            So, on the Wikipedia home page there are links for Wikipedia sections of different languages, so I want to click on English.
            Then once it is on the English Wikipedia, Main page there. I want to search for a term.
            There is a text box on the main English page of Wikipedia.
            And there I can type in the search term that I want to search.</p></p>
            So,
            this is the main English page
            of Wikipedia so I am going to search for "software" and submit this page.
            So, since the "software" has just one article in Wikipedia,
            it will directly take us to the software page.</p></p>
            And then I want to close the browser, so this is what we are trying to achieve today.
            Now, let us see how we can accomplish these user actions in Selenium WebDriver.
            So, this is the Eclipse Ide for Java developers. If you don't have, it you can go www.eclipse.org
            And from there,
            you can download the latest eclipse editor. So, all I have done is created a new Java project.
            You can create a Java project by giving File > New Java project and give the name.
            Then it comes with an src folder built into it within src.</p></p>
            We can create any package. This is an optional step really.
            And within the package or the src folder, you can right click and click on New
            class and then it will ask you, What is the name of the class?
            And in my case, I gave the name of the class as TestWikipedia.</p></p>
            Now, before I start writing code with WebDriver, I have to include
            the WebDriver reference to this project, so how to include it is, you right-click on the project and you go to the project properties.
            Then go to the Java build path and here click on Add external jars.</p></p>
            Now,
            the external jars
            are in this folder that we just extracted.
            Not this one, so let me remove this add external jars
            And here there is going to be a folder.
            So, let me find where it is.</p></p>
            D:\Downloads\WebDriver
            Then
            This was D:\Downloads\WebDriver\selenium-java-2.40.0
            This is the folder which we unzipped so it contains a folder of the same name.
            And within this we get a couple of jar files. So, select both of them and click on Open.
            And there are more jar files, but they are within the libs folder.
            So within libs, I just do a Ctrl+A and select all of them and click on Open and just click on OK.
            So, now this particular project selenium tutorial 2 has a reference to all the latest Selenium WebDriver jar files.
            So, basically it has all the
            Selenium WebDriver latest code available.
            So, let us get started with writing the code.
            So, first what I want to do is
            create a driver object.</p></p>
            So in Selenium,
            the type of that object is a WebDriver, so I give the data type as WebDriver.
            WebDriver driver = new and I want to use
            Firefox browser,
            WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
            Now here you can see a couple of errors are over here. That is because we have not put the import statement.
            So, if you hover your mouse on the error, it gives you some quick fixes so I can import the WebDriver and
            it is showing
            where exactly in the selenium webdriver jar files this class
            is present so just click on import WebDriver.
            And similar thing we can do for the Firefox driver. import FirefoxDriver.
            So, automatically Eclipse adds those
            import statements.</p></p>
            So, I have created the driver object. Now, what I want to do is navigate to the Wikipedia main website.
            So, the command for that is "get". So driver .get and after get,
            we can give the URL.
            So, I can give the entire URL
            http://www.wikipedia.org
            Then once it navigates over there, I want to click on the English link, so first I need to reference it.
            So, there is a
            object WebElement
            So I have just created a
            link object of the type WebElement and
            import this one also.</p></p>
            And what I want to do is find this link on the main Wikipedia page. So, I can give link = driver.
            and the method to find an element on the web page is findElement.
            So I give findElement and there are several ways to find the element.
            But we have to use the By method.</p></p>
            So I am going to use By.linkText because I know that the text is always going to contain "English".
            And this is where I want to go.</p></p>
            So, I get a reference
            to the link now what I want to do is click on that link so that it takes me to the English website.
            So link.click method
            Sorry, not clear!
            I want to click on that link and
            then I just wanted to wait there for some time.
            So we can use the Thread.sleep command of Java.
            Then here give the time in milliseconds, so let us say, I just want to wait for
            five thousand milliseconds or five seconds.</p></p>
            Then,
            once we are on the English main page
            of Wikipedia,
            what we need to do is enter our search term in the search text box.
            But before that we have to get rid of this error.
            So Thread.sleep
            can throw an exception. So what we can do is just click on Add throws exception.
            And that will take care of it, so there are no errors .
            In fact, you cannot run a Java program if there are any compliation errors in it.
            It simply won't run.</p></p>
            So, next what I want to do is
            create a reference to the search text box. So create another WebElement.
            WebElement searchBox
            and I need to find the search box on the English page, so searchBox = driver.findElement
            and
            I know the id of that element is
            "searchInput", so I am going to use By.Id
            And I can put in the Id here.</p></p>
            searchInput
            So, I have found out the search box. Now, what I want to do is type in my search term inside the search box.
            So the command, WebDriver command for that is
            sendKeys. searchBox.sendKeys and
            what I want to type in the search box is
            "software"
            Then, again
            I want it to just wait for some time so I am going to put another sleep for 5 seconds.
            and meanwhile it can
            wait and after that, I just want to close the browser instance of WebDriver, so I give driver.quit();
            So that is the code that I already demonstrated on the Wikipedia page so all we need to do now is
            run it to see if it works as
            per our
            expectation. So I am running it now and once WebDriver
            runs, it can create a new instance of the Firefox browser.
            So, you can see it has opened an instance of the Firefox browser and down below you can see WebDriver is written over here.
            My hands are away from the keyboard and the mouse.
            And automatically it is going to find the web element with English and go to the English, main page.
            So, you can see the URL has already updated and it is on the English
            Wikipedia website.</p></p>
            And
            once it is over there, it will
            look for ... so the English page is there. It has put the software search term and
            then quit.</p></p>
            One thing we missed over here. Is that we did not actually navigate to the software page.
            That is because we did not submit it.
            So, we can just give searchBox.submit(); and that will take care of it.</p></p>
            So, let us just run it one more time to see everything works as per our expectation.
            Working with Selenium WebDriver is
            very easy and WebDriver has a lot of
            powerful commands that you can use in your test automation.
            You can implement the logic or any logic that you can
            implement in a programming language and
            use those powerful features of the programming language along with the powerful features of Selenium WebDriver and
            you can easily automate
            your test cases and create your automated test scripts
            in Selenium WebDriver in the programming language of your choice.
            So in the execution we are on software and now it should
            submit it. Meaning Eress enter on the page to re-post it.</p></p>
            And now you can see the URL is updated and the Wikipedia is on the
            Software page and then after waiting 5 seconds, it will automatically close the browser instance of Firefox.
            So,
            that is how we do the test automation in WebDriver.
            One powerful advantage of WebDriver Is that it works in multiple browsers we can work in Firefox,
            So we can work in internet explorer. We can work in
            Chrome. We can work in Opera. We can work in Safari, so let us see how we can update our
            automated test Script over here to use instead of using Firefox, we can use Internet Explorer.
            So, the way to do it is very simple.</p></p>
            So, all we need to do is... I am going to comment out the line over here.
            In
            Internet Explorer
            we have to do one more thing and that is we have to set the property so I am writing System.setProperty
            and
            we have to give a couple of values here. This is just a one-time activity.
            webdriver.ie.driver and
            here I have to give the path of where I have downloaded this file. This file is also available from the
            seleniumhq.org
            website
            Now, after this all I need to do is
            last time we put WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
            But this time what we are going to do is put
            WebDriver driver=new InternetExplorerDriver();
            and
            here there is an error that is because we have not put the import statement.
            So let us put the import statement over here.
            And that is the only change we need to make in this automated test script.</p></p>
            Earlier, it was running with Firefox, but now it should run with the Internet Explorer browser.
            So let us run this now to see if it works.
            With Internet Explorer exactly the same code that we have already written.
            So you can see WebDriver has launched Internet Explorer browser it has navigated to the Wikipedia
            website
            And now it should click on the English link to go to the English Wikipedia main page
            and
            yes, it has done that then it should type "Software' in the search text box.
            And
            submit that form to go to the Software Wikipedia page, so it has typed "Software"
            Now it should navigate to the
            Software Wikipedia page and then automatically close the internet Explorer browser.
            So that is how simple it is to switch from one browser to another. So I hope this gives you some
            idea and appreciation about Selenium WebDriver.
            For more details, you can
            contact us for the Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver training. We cover a number of topics in that training
            first of all we cover object-oriented programming concepts
            Then we cover the Java programming and then we covered Selenium webdriver commands in detail.
            And we also cover TestNG.
            unit testing framework and also page object pattern. So, you can find the contact details in
            the description below this video and
            you can take that training for getting very deep knowledge of Selenium WebDriver and
            programming logic
            with Java so that you can be very competent at
            web test automation using Selenium WebDriver. Thank you.
